<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>

<p>
  I really love programing and computer-related things in general. I even used
  to code all day when I first got into this (don't do that lol).

<h2 id="drawing">Drawing</h2>

<p>
  I really love art and all kinds of art, and drawing is a type of art that I
  can do too!
</p>

<p>
  I don't remember when I started drawing "for real", but it was probably around
  2022 or 2023? I really don't remember lol.
</p>

<p>
  My inspiration when I started was anime and
  <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/">osu!</a> title screen backgrounds. I thought
  they were cool and wanted to make cool stuff as well :3
</p>

<p>
  Though nowadays most of what motivates me to keep drawing is wanting to
  someday create something as cool as the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project">Touhou Project</a>.
</p>

<p>The drawing at the top of the page is made by me btw :3</p>

<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>

<p>
  Writing is something that I started to do recently. I started with the goal of
  writing a world for future games I wanna make, but writing a world turned out
  to be a very cool activity as well :3
</p>

<h2 id="games">Games</h2>

<p>
  My favorite games are the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project">Touhou Project</a>
  games, UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE, and Minecraft.
</p>

<p>
  The first game I've really gotten into was Minecraft. I used to play a lot of
  modded Minecraft all day, but nowadays I don't really play it as much.
</p>

<p>
  I also used to be really into UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE. I don't play those
  games as much these days, but they're still an inspiration for creating my own
  games.
</p>

<p>
  I used to play osu! a lot too. In fact, before I started drawing frequently, I
  only used my drawing tablet to play osu! basically. Though now I don't play it
  as much anymore.
</p>

<p>
  Nowadays, the Touhou games are by far my favorite games and my biggest
  inspiration for creating my own projects. I started playing them after
  constantly receiving recommendations for Touhou song covers from
  <a href="https://youtube.com/@ViddyWellSA11">ViddyWell</a> on YouTube, and
  after getting curious enough about the games and their music to research
  Touhou and eventually play Touhou Koumakyou ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil
  as my first Touhou game.
</p>

<p>
  My favorite Touhou games are Touhou Eiyashou ~ Imperishable Night and Touhou
  Kanjuden ~ Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom. I love both of these games for their
  stories and soundtracks, both of which are absolutely great.
</p>

<h2 id="manga">Manga</h2>

<p>
  I don't read manga lol. The only manga I've ever read was Yagate Kimi ni Naru,
  which is a really nice and cute yuri romance that I really recommend :3
</p>

<p>
  After reading that manga and really enjoying it, I did the most rational thing
  and never touched a manga ever again.
</p>

<h2 id="anime">Anime</h2>

<p>
  I also don't really watch anime these days. The first anime I've ever watched
  was Kaguya-sama: Love is War, because I was curious about what this whole
  anime thing was about. The first anime that I've really gotten into was JoJo
  no Kimyou na Bouken (I used to know A LOT about this anime).
</p>

<p>
  Here's a list of the animes I like the most. This isn't a full list, as it
  includes only the anime that I liked enough to consider worth listing here:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kaguya-sama: Love is War;</li>
  <li>JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken;</li>
  <li>Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu;</li>
  <li>Little Witch Academia;</li>
  <li>Bocchi the Rock!</li>
</ul>
