<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm a trans girl <img src="assets/trans-flag-emoji.png" alt="Trans Flag Emoji"> that likes doing stuff with computers and making art.</p>
<h2>Some things about me</h2>
<p><b>Games:</b> The games I play the most are osu!, Undertale, and Deltarune.</p>
<p><b>Software:</b> I prefer using Linux as my main OS, and I typically avoid closed-source software. Though I don't mind using closed-source software if I need to.</br>
I use Krita as my drawing software, GIMP as my image editor, and Emacs as my text editor.</br>
My favorite versions of Windows are Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.</p>
<p><b>Interests:</b> I like drawing, system programming, and sometimes 3D modelling.</p>
<p><b>Coolest Projects:</b> My coolest projects are definitely my own Lisp-like programming language (<a href="https://github.com/HatsuSixty/loisp">Loisp</a>) and a simple display server with its own window manager (<a href="https://github.com/HatsuSixty/AppDrawer">AppDrawer</a>).</p>
<p><b>And most importantly:</b> My favorite colors are purple and pink.</p>
