<h1>About</h1>

<p>(originally created December 27 2023, rewritten from scratch August 22 2024, ported to new site November 01 2024)</p>

<p>Hi, I'm a transgender girl who enjoys creating stuff!</p>
<p>You can call me Hatsu, Amanda or Amy, either is fine!</p>
<p>Below are some things about me, if you're interested.</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>

<p>I like programming and computers in general. I consider myself pretty good at programming actually. I'm more
  interested in systems programming and low level stuff, but I really like programming in general.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>I generally prefer to use open source software, but I don't mind having to use proprietary software if I need to. For
  example, I like to use Linux on my computers, but I won't find it annoying if I have to work with other operating
  systems if I have to.</p>

<h2>Drawing</h2>

<p>I also like to draw! I don't really post my art online, primarily because I don't think it's good enough to show it
  to everyone. Sometimes I might end up sharing some of my drawings though.</p>

<h2>Games</h2>

<p>The first game I've really gotten into was Minecraft, so it's naturally one of my favorite games, even though I don't
  play it as much anymore.</p>

<p>Other games I really like are Undertale and Deltarune. These two games are amazing and they are a big inspiration for
  my game projects.</p>

<p>Speaking of big inspirations, I REALLY like the Touhou Project series. Like, a lot. I'm not good at the games, but
  the characters, story and music are simply one of the biggest, if not the biggest, inspiration for my future game
  projects.</p>

<h2>Future game projects?</h2>

<p>Yeah. I can't say much about it. Just know that I have pretty big plans about this thing :3</p>

<h2>Anime</h2>

<p>I don't really watch anime anymore, but I used to do it a lot.</p>

<p>My favorite anime is JoJo's Bizarre Adventures. It is the first anime I've really gotten into, so it is really
  special for me.</p>

<p>But the actual first anime I've ever watched was Kaguya-sama: Love is War. I don't know what to say about it
  other than that it's a really good anime, and I really recommend checking it out!</p>

<p>Also, I couldn't talk about anime without talking about Re:Zero. I haven't seen enough of it to consider it my
  favorite anime, but it's definitely at least my second favorite. Something about it just plays with my emotions in a
  special way. Don't know how to really describe it. I just recommend watching.</p>

<p>Nowadays I have a lot of hobbies, and among them, watching anime does not appeal that much, so I just stopped
  watching anime. I kinda plan to get back into it though.</p>

<h2>Manga</h2>

<p>I've only ever finished one manga, that being Yagate Kimi ni Naru. It's a really good Yuri romance, really recommend
  it!</p>

<h2>AND MOST IMPORTANTLY</h2>

<p>Purple and pink are my favorite colors. These are just the prettiest ones. Period.</p>
