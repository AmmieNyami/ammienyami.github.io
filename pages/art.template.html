      <h3>Portrait</h3>

      <p>
        The first drawing I've ever shared online. I originally created it with
        the purpose of using it in the About page of my website. My inspiration
        for the outfit was
        <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Renko_Usami">Usami Renko</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you flip the image, you can see her face looks a bit assymetrical.
        Someone clearly didn't flip the canvas enough while drawing to catch
        this problem. Oops!
      </p>

      <p>(I actually didn't flip the canvas at all lol)</p>
