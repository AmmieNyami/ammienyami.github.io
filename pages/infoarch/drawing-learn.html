<h1>How to learn drawing?</h1>
<p>In this page I will write about how I am learning drawing and about what resources I am using to do so. Keep in mind that I'm specifically focused in drawing characters. <b>It's also important to note that I'm still pretty much a beginner, and I'm only writing notes about how I started drawing and what helped me to get into drawing.</b></p>

<h2>How did I start studying to begin with?</h2>
<p>What got me inspired and also showed to me what drawing characters is like were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SomeNormalArtist">SomeNormalArtist</a>'s tutorials on how to draw. From his videos I learned basic things like "How to draw an anime head" or "How to draw hair", etc. But obviously that only served as an initial incentive to get me into drawing, as expecting to draw something good right away just by getting into these tutorials would obviously not work. So I needed a more detailed roadmap...</p>

<h2>The roadmap I went with.... initially</h2>
<p>The video that really helped me to start studying drawing was <a href="https://youtu.be/1jjmOF1hQqI">Draw like a Sir's roadmap</a>. I learned a lot by following each step in the roadmap, but eventually I stopped following it. I just got bored of studying anatomy and drawing poses instead of drawing <i>actual characters</i>. So that's what I did. I started designing my own character, and that went well. Things started getting complicated when I tried drawing my character in an <i>actual</i> pose. I clearly needed to properly study character drawing.</p>

<h2>Studying character drawing</h2>
<p>Some videos that really helped to get into character drawing were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Kooleen">Kooleen</a>'s tutorials and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@YTartschool">Marc Brunet</a>'s <a href="https://youtu.be/hGzYHenpQpU">"Learn to draw characters in 30 days"</a> schedule, and right now I'm following Marc's study schedule. I can already tell that it will really help me to improve in character drawing, and I would definitely recommend it.</p>
