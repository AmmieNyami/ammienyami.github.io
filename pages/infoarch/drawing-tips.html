<h1>Drawing Tips</h1>
<p>In this page I will be showing some drawing tips I learned while studying drawing, in no particular ordering.</p>

<h2>1: Use a reasonable resolution for your canvas</h2>
<p>While drawing I noticed that canvas with resolutions below 3000x3000 are very hard to draw, because when you try to add very small details, you end up working at pixel level.</p>
<p>I personally like to use 4000x4000 when drawing.</p>

<h2>2: Copying > Tracing</h2>
<p>Mindlessly tracing artworks/reference images will <i><b>not</b></i> help you improve your drawing skills</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you try to copy an artwork as best as you can, by trying to replicate it, you will get more familiar with the shapes and other elements that make up a good artwork.</p>
<p>Though if you pay attention to what you're drawing while you trace something, you can improve your drawing skills, but I still wouldn't recommend it.</p>

<h2>3: Observation</h2>
<p>You've probably heard about that before, but I'm not talking about only observing other artworks, I'm talking about observing everything, including real life.</p>
<p>When you look at something, try to imagine the shapes that make up that thing.</p>
<p>Doing that, even for brief moments, can help you level up your drawing skills.</p>

<h2>4: Watch people draw!</h2>
<p>Watch art content creators, not only is it fun, but you can also learn something from it!.</p>

<p><b>Please keep in mind that I'm still pretty much a beginner</b>, though I do believe these are some good tips. As I said, these are things I learned <b><i>while studying</i></b> drawing, and I'm still studying.</p>

<h3>That's it! I hope someone finds this information useful.</h3>
