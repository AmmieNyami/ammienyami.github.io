        It's my sona again! This time in an outfit that better fits a <i>Specific
        Setting</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This time the outfit was <del>stolen from</del> inspired by
        <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Aya_Shameimaru">Shameimaru Aya</a>'s.

    <img
      alt="an anime-style drawing of a smiling girl with long light purple hair and red eyes, wearing a black blazer, a red tie, and a white skirt. she has white rabbit ears with red interior and a dark, patterned silhouette behind her. to her right, vertical japanese text that reads '鈴仙・優曇華院・イナバ' is visible in the background"

        A drawing of the moon rabbit
        <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Reisen_Udongein_Inaba">Reisen</a
        >!
      </p>

      <p>
        I was a bit unsure about her smile, so I made a
        <a href="/images/drawings/bnnuy-not-d.png"
          >version with her mouth closed</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        This time I created a background for this one! For the silhouette, I
        tried to create something somewhat similar to the backgrounds found on
        Touhou jewel case covers. I don't know if I succeeded, but it definitely
        turned out pretty cool.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not quite content with the face on this one. I definitely can and have
        done better than that in the past.

      <h3>Portrait</h3>

      <p>Drawing finished on May 31st, 2025.</p>

      <p>
        The first drawing I've ever shared online. I originally created it with
        the purpose of using it in the About page of my website. My inspiration
        for the outfit was
        <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Renko_Usami">Usami Renko</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you flip the image, you can see her face looks a bit assymetrical.
        Someone clearly didn't flip the canvas enough while drawing to catch
        this problem. Oops!
      </p>

      <p>(I actually didn't flip the canvas at all lol)</p>
