      <p>Drawing finished on September 5th, 2025.</p>

      <p>
        It's my sona yet again, this time in
        <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Cirno">Cirno</a>'s outfit! Just as
        appropriate for Cirno day, ⑨/⑨  :3
      </p>

      <p>
        I finished it on September 5th, but I posted it online for the first time
        on September 9th (of course).
      </p>

      <p>
        I usually take a lot of time to finish a drawing, so this time I wanted to
        try a simpler style that I could finish quicker. It turned out pretty cool
        I think :3

      alt="a full-body anime-style drawing of a girl with a happy expression, long purple hair and matching cat ears. she's wearing a white collared shirt with a black bow tie, a black shirt extending beyond her waist and tied up by a black ribbon, and white socks and black shoes. there is a black border around her and two faint, light silhouettes behind her and slightly offset to the left of each other, with the one closest to her being purple and the other being pink. everything is on a white background"

      <h3>Me again :D</h3>

      <p>Drawing finished on August 31st, 2025.</p>

      <p>
        It's my sona again! This time in an outfit that better fits a <i>Specific
        Setting</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This time the outfit was <del>stolen from</del> inspired by
        <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Aya_Shameimaru">Shameimaru Aya</a>'s.

    <img
      alt="an anime-style drawing of a smiling girl with long light purple hair and red eyes, wearing a black blazer, a red tie, and a white skirt. she has white rabbit ears with red interior and a dark, patterned silhouette behind her. to her right, vertical japanese text that reads '鈴仙・優曇華院・イナバ' is visible in the background"

        A drawing of the moon rabbit
        <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Reisen_Udongein_Inaba">Reisen</a
        >!
      </p>

      <p>
        I was a bit unsure about her smile, so I made a
        <a href="/images/drawings/bnnuy-not-d.png"
          >version with her mouth closed</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        This time I created a background for this one! For the silhouette, I
        tried to create something somewhat similar to the backgrounds found on
        Touhou jewel case covers. I don't know if I succeeded, but it definitely
        turned out pretty cool.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not quite content with the face on this one. I definitely can and have
        done better than that in the past.

      <h3>Portrait</h3>

      <p>Drawing finished on May 31st, 2025.</p>

      <p>
        The first drawing I've ever shared online. I originally created it with
        the purpose of using it in the About page of my website. My inspiration
        for the outfit was
        <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Renko_Usami">Usami Renko</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you flip the image, you can see her face looks a bit assymetrical.
        Someone clearly didn't flip the canvas enough while drawing to catch
        this problem. Oops!
      </p>

      <p>(I actually didn't flip the canvas at all lol)</p>
