    <img
      alt="An anime-style drawing of Junko from Touhou Project standing smiling with her hands slightly raised and her head slightly tilted. She has very long blonde hair, red eyes and wears a very long black robe with wide sleeves and red inner sleeves. She wears a long bright-red piece of cloth spread on the front of the outfit and descending from her shoulders to her legs, tied at her neck with a bright-yellow string and at her waist with a waist ribbon. It has bright yellow, orange and blue patterns. She's also wearing a black traditional Chinese crown called a dalachi, with red and yellow patterns on top of a black background on its front. She has a black border around her and behind her is a faint purple pink-ish silhouette of the same character with a flowery pattern."

      <h3>Junko</h3>

      <p>Drawing finished on November 7th, 2025.</p>

      <p>
        Junko from
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project">Touhou Project</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started drawing her because I wanted to draw something, but I didn't
        know what to, so I put on some music and Junko's theme was the first
        song that started playing.

      <h3>⑨</h3>

      <p>Drawing finished on September 5th, 2025.</p>

      <p>
        It's my sona yet again, this time in
        <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Cirno">Cirno</a>'s outfit! Just as
        appropriate for Cirno day, ⑨/⑨  :3
      </p>

      <p>
        I finished it on September 5th, but I posted it online for the first time
        on September 9th (of course).
      </p>

      <p>
        I usually take a lot of time to finish a drawing, so this time I wanted to
        try a simpler style that I could finish quicker. It turned out pretty cool
        I think :3

      <h3>Me again :D</h3>

      <p>Drawing finished on August 31st, 2025.</p>

      <p>
        It's my sona again! This time in an outfit that better fits a <i>Specific
        Setting</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This time the outfit was <del>stolen from</del> inspired by
        <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Aya_Shameimaru">Shameimaru Aya</a>'s.

    <img
      alt="an anime-style drawing of a smiling girl with long light purple hair and red eyes, wearing a black blazer, a red tie, and a white skirt. she has white rabbit ears with red interior and a dark, patterned silhouette behind her. to her right, vertical japanese text that reads '鈴仙・優曇華院・イナバ' is visible in the background"

      <p>
        A drawing of the moon rabbit
        <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Reisen_Udongein_Inaba">Reisen</a
        >!
      </p>

      <p>
        I was a bit unsure about her smile, so I made a
        <a href="/images/drawings/bnnuy-not-d.png"
          >version with her mouth closed</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        This time I created a background for this one! For the silhouette, I
        tried to create something somewhat similar to the backgrounds found on
        Touhou jewel case covers. I don't know if I succeeded, but it definitely
        turned out pretty cool.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not quite content with the face on this one. I definitely can and have
        done better than that in the past.

      <h3>Portrait</h3>

      <p>Drawing finished on May 31st, 2025.</p>

      <p>
        The first drawing I've ever shared online. I originally created it with
        the purpose of using it in the About page of my website. My inspiration
        for the outfit was
        <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Renko_Usami">Usami Renko</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you flip the image, you can see her face looks a bit assymetrical.
        Someone clearly didn't flip the canvas enough while drawing to catch
        this problem. Oops!
      </p>

      <p>(I actually didn't flip the canvas at all lol)</p>
