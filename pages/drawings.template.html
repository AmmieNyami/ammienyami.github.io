        >!

      <p>
        I was a bit unsure about her smile, so I made a
        <a href="/images/drawings/bnnuy-not-d.png"
          >version with her mouth closed</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        This time I created a background for this one! For the silhouette, I
        tried to create something somewhat similar to the backgrounds found on
        Touhou jewel case covers. I don't know if I succeeded, but it definitely
        turned out pretty cool.

      <p>
        Not quite content with the face on this one. I definitely can and have
        done better than that in the past.

      <h3>Portrait</h3>

      <p>Drawing finished on May 31st, 2025.</p>

      <p>
        The first drawing I've ever shared online. I originally created it with
        the purpose of using it in the About page of my website. My inspiration
        for the outfit was
        <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Renko_Usami">Usami Renko</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you flip the image, you can see her face looks a bit assymetrical.
        Someone clearly didn't flip the canvas enough while drawing to catch
        this problem. Oops!
      </p>

      <p>(I actually didn't flip the canvas at all lol)</p>
