<p>
  genkeys is program that reads a configuration file containing key binding
  definitions and generates key binding definitions in another configuration
  format specified by the user. This is useful if you have multiple window
  managers/wayland compositors installed and want your key bindings to be the
  same across them.
</p>

<p>
  genkeys supports generating key bindings for sway/i3, hyprland and bspwm
  (sxhkd).
</p>

<p>
  Information about genkeysâ€™ configuration file and options can be found in its
  help command, where you can read about customizing the paths of the generated
  files and the syntax of the configuration file.
