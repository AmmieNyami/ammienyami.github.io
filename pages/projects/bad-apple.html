  <h1>Fake "Bad Apple!!" stop motion</h1>

<p>This project consists of a bunch of scripts I used to generate a video that looks like a stop motion of Bad Apple!!.
  The video can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/gXCPThl0wTY">here</a>, and the source code of the project can be
  found <a href="https://github.com/HatsuSixty/bad-apple-stopmotion">here</a>.</p>

<p>The video isnâ€™t of the full animation because it would take too much time to render.</p>

<p>I created this because I was too lazy to do my art homework lol</p>
