<h1>AppDrawer</h1>
<a href="https://github.com/HatsuSixty/AppDrawer">Project's Source Code</a>
<p>AppDrawer is a simple display server written from scratch in C++ with no dependencies (besides raylib for rendering). It manages windows by itself so it can also be considered a simple window manager.</p>

<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>AppDrawer initially creates 2 threads: a rendering thread and a server thread. The rendering thread renders the state of the server, and the server thread waits for connections. Each connection creates a separate thread for listening to commands from the client. The clients can send commands such as "get window display" or "create window". The so called "window display" is a shared memory region containing RGBA data that gets rendered into the actual window. To receive events, clients must tell the server to start sending events to a specific client. The server just sends events through the regular server socket.</p>
<p>The definitions of the structures used to communicate with the server are defined in a C header called "RudeDrawer".</p>
<p>A library called LibDraw is provided as an abstraction layer on top of raw socket communication between client and server.</p>

<h1>Inspiration</h1>
<p>I started this project planning to eventually build all of the other components that make a graphical operating system, effectively building a full operating system from scratch, with the only third-party component being the kernel (the <a href="https://kernel.org">Linux</a> kernel).</p>
<p>This operating system would be inspired by the 90's/early 2000's productivity software user interfaces, like <a href="https://serenityos.org">SerenityOS</a> is.</p>
