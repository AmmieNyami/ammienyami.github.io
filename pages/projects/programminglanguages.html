<h1>Programming Languages</h1>
<p>This page is dedicated to some simple programming languages I made.</p>

<h2>Nolang</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/HatsuSixty/nolang">Project's Source Code</a>
<p>This was one of the first, if not the first, programming languages I made. So if for some reason you decide to read the source code for this language, please don't judge much.</p>
<p>It is a simple stack-based programming language I made inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily">Tsoding</a>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VbMZA7wW9aR3EtBqe2kinu4">Porth Series</a>.</p>
<p>The compiler generates assembly and then compiles with an assembler, generating the final executable.</p>

<h2>Loisp</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/HatsuSixty/loisp">Project's Source Code</a>
<p>This is a Lisp-like (S-expression based) programming language I made also inspired by a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily">Tsoding</a> made. The original video was deleted by some reason.</p>
<p>The compiler is written in Rust and, like the previous one, compiles to assembly.</p>

<h2>North</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/HatsuSixty/north">Project's Source Code</a>
<p>This is the latest one I made. It's written in Python (yes, <a href="https://www.python.org/">this Python</a>) and is almost a <a href="https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth">Porth</a> clone. This one can compile to assembly and C.</p>
<p>The C backend is because I wanted this language to be able to call to C functions, but I didn't know that the main stack was also the call stack, so I had some problems while trying to get assembly to call to libc functions.</p>
