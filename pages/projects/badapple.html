<h1>Bad Apple!! stop motion, except it isn't...</h1>
<a href="https://github.com/HatsuSixty/bad-apple-stopmotion">Project's Source Code</a>
<p>This project consists of a bunch of scripts I used to generate a video that looks like a stop motion of <a href="https://youtu.be/FtutLA63Cp8">Bad Apple!!</a>. <a href="https://youtu.be/xo8ITl-DtbM">The video can be found here</a>. The video isn't of the full animation because it would take too much time to render.</p>
<p>I made this project because my art teacher (in the country I live, art is one of the subjects we learn in school) gave us a homework where we would create a stop motion animation of a music clip. Aaaand I wanted to cheat a little bit <img src="assets/minetest-server-juanchi-face.png" alt="Minetest Server's 'Juanchi Face' Emoji">.</p>
