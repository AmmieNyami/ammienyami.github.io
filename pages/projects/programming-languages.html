<p>Cool programming languages I made :3</p>
<p>I'm not actively maintaining any of these but I might update them in the future.</p>

<h2>Old Projects</h2>

<p>These projects were made back when I didn't have much programming experience. Don't judge the source code pls thx.
</p>

<h3>Nolang</h3>

<a href="https://github.com/HatsuSixty/nolang">Project’s Source Code</a>

<p>This was one of the first, if not the first programming language I made. So, again, if for some reason
  you decide to read the source code for this language, please don’t judge much.</p>

<p>It is a simple stack-based programming language I made inspired by
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily">Tsoding</a>’s
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VbMZA7wW9aR3EtBqe2kinu4">Porth</a>
  Series.
</p>

<p>The compiler works by generating assembly and then compiling it with an assembler, generating the final executable.
</p>

<h3>Loisp</h3>

<a href="https://github.com/HatsuSixty/loisp">Project’s Source Code</a>

<p>This is a Lisp-like (S-expression based) programming language I made also inspired by a video
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily">Tsoding</a> made. The original video was deleted for some reason.
</p>

<p>The compiler is written in Rust and, like the previous language, compiles to assembly. It also has an interpreter and
  a semi-functioning (hehe) REPL.</p>

<h2>Newer projects</h2>

<p>The source code of these isn't half as bad as the previous ones.</p>

<h3>North</h3>

<a href="https://github.com/HatsuSixty/north">Project’s Source Code</a>

<p>This is a stack-based programmming language written in Python (yes,
  <a href="https://www.python.org/">this Python</a>) and is almost a
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth">Porth</a> clone. This one can
  be compiled to assembly and C.
</p>

<p>The C backend is because I wanted this language to be able to call to C functions, but I didn’t know that the main
  stack was also the call stack, so I had some problems while trying to get assembly to call to C functions.</p>

<h3>Niban</h3>

<a href="https://github.com/HatsuSixty/niban">Project’s Source Code</a>

<p>This is the latest one I made. It's my first procedural and imperative programming language. It aims to be a simple
  language, like C, with more convenient features. No package manager. No multiple ways to do the same thing.</p>

<p>The compiler is written in Rust and uses <a href="https://c9x.me/compile/">QBE</a> as a backend.</p>
