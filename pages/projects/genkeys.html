<p>genkeys is program that reads a configuration file containing key binding definitions and generates key
  binding definitions in another configuration format specified by the user. This is useful if you have multiple
  window managers/wayland compositors installed and want your key bindings to be the same across them.</p>

<p>genkeys supports generating key bindings for sway/i3, hyprland and bspwm (sxhkd).</p>

<p>Information about genkeysâ€™ configuration file and options can be found in its help command, where you can read about
  customizing the paths of the generated files and the syntax of the configuration file.</p>
