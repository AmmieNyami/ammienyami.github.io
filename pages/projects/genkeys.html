<p>genkeys is program that reads a configuration file containing keybinding definitions and generates keybinding
  definitions in another configuration format specified by the user. This is useful if you have multiple window
  managers/wayland compositors installed and want your keybindings to be the same across them.</p>

<p>genkeys supports generating keybindings for sway/i3, hyprland and bspwm (sxhkd).</p>

<p>Information about genkeysâ€™ configuration file and options can be found in its help command, where you can read about
  customizing the paths of the generated files and the syntax of the configuration file.</p>
