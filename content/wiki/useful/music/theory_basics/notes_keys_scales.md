## Notes

Sound is made of vibrations. When the vibrations are faster we hear them as being higher and when the vibrations are slower we hear them as being lower. When the vibrations happen at a consistent rate, we perceive them as having a consistent pitch, and this is what we call a **"note"**.

### There are only 12 notes

The vast ***majority*** of popular music was composed using only twelve notes. The notes are (as in a piano):
- White notes: A, B, C, D, E, F, G
- Black notes: A♯/B♭, C♯/D♭, D♯/E♭, F♯/G♭, G♯/A♭

Where:
- ♯ (Sharp) means half tone above a note
- ♭ (Flat) means half tone below a note

*NOTE: the distance of going twelve notes up or down to the next identically named note is called an **octave**.*  
*NOTE: an increment between notes is called a semitone/half step.*  
*NOTE: an increment between two semitones/half steps is called a whole step/whole tone/tone.*

## Keys

There are common combinations of notes that we call a *key*. A key is a combination of notes that sound good together in a piece of music, and most pieces of music use only one key. **The words "key" and "scale" are often used interchangeably.**

For better understanding:
- A key is like a home "base" group of notes that a song is based on
- A scale is like a set of notes that you play in conjunction with a key

A lot of times your playing the same scale that matches the key that you're in, and other times, depending on the gender or style of your song, you use a different scale.

## Going deeper: Analyzing the C major scale

If we're in the key of C, we call C the root note, and that's the note that the scale starts with.

As we go up in the scale, the notes have a spacing of:

- A tone (up two notes)
- A tone (up two notes)
- A semitone (up one note)
- A tone (up two notes)
- A tone (up two notes)
- A tone (up two notes)
- A semitone (up one note)

And that's the "formula" of a **major scale**.

If you pick a key in a piano, and follow this sequence, you will get a major scale.
