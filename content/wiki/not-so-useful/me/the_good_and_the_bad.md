***Warning:*** This is just stuff that I believe in, and there's the chance that I have no idea what I'm talking about. You might consider the stuff I write here BS or not. So if I say something stupid, ignore it.

## What I consider to be good and what I consider to be bad

I like think of this in a simple way:

- If what you do hurts someone in a bad way, it's bad.
- If what you do does not do anything bad to anyone, it's good.

### What does it mean to hurt someone in a bad way?

It means that you did something that made someone feel bad or hurt.
