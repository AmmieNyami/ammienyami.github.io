***WARNING:*** This is just stuff that I believe in, and there's the chance that I have no idea what I'm talking about. You might consider the stuff I write here BS or not. So if you think I said something stupid, please ignore it, it's likely that I will end up thinking it was stupid as well.

## What I consider to be good and what I consider to be bad

I like think of this in a simple way:

- If what you do hurts someone in a bad way, it's bad.
- If what you do does not do anything bad to anyone, it's good.

### What does it mean to hurt someone in a bad way?

It means that you did something that impacted someone's life in a bad way, even if it was a small impact.

The important word here is "impacted someone's ***life***". 

*If you, for example, said something that made someone realize something bad, it might make that person feel hurt. But in the end, that realization may end up not impacting that person's life in a bad way, and might even help them. In case it doesn't, then you said something bad.*

That was just an example but it applies to other things in life as well.
