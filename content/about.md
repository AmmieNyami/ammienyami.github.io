About
Hi! I'm a trans girl ![Trans Flag Emoji](/trans-flag-emoji.png) that likes doing stuff with computers and making art.

# Some things about me

- **Games:** The games I play the most are osu!, Undertale, and Deltarune.
- **Software:** I prefer using Linux as my main OS, and I typically avoid closed-source software. Though I don't mind using closed-source software if I need to.
I use Krita as my drawing software, GIMP as my image editor, and Emacs as my text editor.
My favorite versions of Windows are Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.
- **Interests:** I like drawing, system programming, and sometimes 3D modelling.
- **Coolest Projects:** My coolest projects are definitely my own Lisp-like programming language ([Loisp](https://github.com/HatsuSixty/loisp)) and a simple display server with its own window manager ([AppDrawer](https://github.com/HatsuSixty/AppDrawer)).
- **And most importantly:** My favorite colors are purple and pink.
